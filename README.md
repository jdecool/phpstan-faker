This PHPStan Reflection Extension can automatically register the methods and properties created by custom Faker providers, so you don't need to instruct PHPStan to ignore the usage of those methods.

## Installation

Via Composer

```bash
composer require --dev swisnl/phpstan-faker
```

If you also have [phpstan/extension-installer](https://github.com/phpstan/extension-installer) installed, then you don't need to follow the instructions for manual installation. Regardless of the installation method, you need to follow the instructions for configuration.

<details>
  <summary>Manual installation</summary>

If you don't want to use `phpstan/extension-installer`, include extension.neon in your project's PHPStan config:

```neon
includes:
    - vendor/swisnl/phpstan-faker/extension.neon
```
</details>

## Configuration

Add the custom faker provider classes to the extension configuration.

```neon
parameters:
    faker:
        providerClasses:
            - App\Faker\MyProvider
```

**This does not actually register the custom providers in Faker, this just tells PHPStan about the custom providers.**
